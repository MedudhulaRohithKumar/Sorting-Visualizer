# Sorting-Visualizer
A Web-Based Tool for Learning Sorting Algorithms Sorting algorithms are
an important part of computer science and are used to arrange data in a
specific order. However, understanding how these algorithms work can be
difficult, especially for beginners. In this project, we aim to make learning about
sorting algorithms more intuitive and engaging through a web- based
visualization tool.
 Our website will be built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and will allow
users to visualize several sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, insertion sort,
selection sort, quick sort, merge sort, and heap sort. Users will be able to input a
random array of data and watch as the sorting algorithms rearrange the data
into the correct order.
 The website will have a user-friendly interface, with clear and concise
explanations of how each algorithm works. We will also provide visual cues, such
as color-coding and animations, to help users understand the sorting process
better. Additionally, we will include interactive features such as the ability to
adjust the speed of the sorting algorithm and pause the animation at any time.
 Our project aims to provide an effective tool for computer science students,
educators, and enthusiasts to learn and understand sorting algorithms better.
By combining web technologies with interactive visualization, we hope to make
the process of learning and mastering sorting algorithms more engaging and
enjoyable
